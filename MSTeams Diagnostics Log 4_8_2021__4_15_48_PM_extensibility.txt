En la sección Entorno de indagación encontrarás artículos, vídeos, animaciones y un banco de imágenes, además de distintas herramientas multimedia como el atlas, el museo virtual, las estadísticas, la cronología, el cuerpo humano, la cartografía, la biblioteca universal, la sala de audición o la Temapedia. Para crear grupo de trabajo con tus alumnos añade contenidos a las pestañas de los canales. Puedes añadir las materias para poder acceder a ellas más fácilmente y también añadir Cuadernos de aprendizaje para tus alumnos. Estos cuadernos pueden estar personalizados. Tus alumnos tendrán también acceso a las unidades de sus Cuadernos y al Entorno de indagación en sus apps personales, a los contenidos que hayas añadido a sus equipos y a los recursos que hayas enviado como tareas de Teams.

Use the app to create collaborative learning spaces within Microsoft Teams and bring your workforce together to assign training, gather instant feedback, encourage collaboration, track engagement and support their development.\n\nCourses from Hays Learning include project and change management, mental health and wellbeing training, health and safety and more, so your team will have much-needed support and access to the latest training, wherever they are, whenever they need it.\n\nThe Hays Learning app adds a Learning tab to your teams. Here, team owners can add resources to the tab to build out their team’s learning space. Resources can be added from your Hays Learning portal, from the Files tab in the team, uploaded from your computer, or inserted as a link from the web. If you have your own training material in SCORM, AICC, LTI, TinCan or xAPI format, those can be uploaded as well. The Hays Learning app is powered by Go1, so users also gain access to Go1’s library of training courses and resources through the app.\n\nTeam members can start a conversation about any of the resources from the Learning tab and continue the conversation with their peers in the conversation tab for that channel, ensuring that everyone stays connected around training. Team members can also pin content they find relevant from conversations to the Learning tab to contribute to the team’s learning space.\n\nStaff training is key to the retention and attraction of key talent, so make sure you’re creating the best learning experience for your workers by sharing courses from your Hays Learning portal - and uploading custom content from your own learning management system.\n\n**Download Hays Learning for Microsoft Teams today, and help your staff succeed.**","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/0f8c4b5a-3d7f-436a-8d07-4ce238924339_largeImage.png?v=1.0","accentColor":"#032677","id":"0f8c4b5a-3d7f-436a-8d07-4ce238924339","name":"Hays Learning","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/0f8c4b5a-3d7f-436a-8d07-4ce238924339_smallImage.png?v=1.0"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"0fc99339-64b5-43d1-8c41-2c61d53a7ab0","appId":"0fc99339-64b5-43d1-8c41-2c61d53a7ab0","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200001776","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/0fc99339-64b5-43d1-8c41-2c61d53a7ab0/1.png?v=1.0.0","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/0fc99339-64b5-43d1-8c41-2c61d53a7ab0/2.png?v=1.0.0","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/0fc99339-64b5-43d1-8c41-2c61d53a7ab0/3.png?v=1.0.0","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/0fc99339-64b5-43d1-8c41-2c61d53a7ab0/4.png?v=1.0.0","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/0fc99339-64b5-43d1-8c41-2c61d53a7ab0/5.png?v=1.0.0"],"manifestVersion":"1.5","version":"1.0.0","categories":["Communication","Productivity","WorkflowAndBusinessManagement"],"developerName":"Imageous","developerUrl":"https://tellroby.com/","privacyUrl":"https://tellroby.com/privacy-policy.html","termsOfUseUrl":"https://tellroby.com/terms-of-service.html","validDomains":["tellroby.com"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"bots":[{"id":"0fc99339-64b5-43d1-8c41-2c61d53a7ab0","scopes":["Personal","Team"],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"staticTabs":[{"entityId":"1","name":"Support","contentUrl":"https://info.tellroby.com/roby-meetings","scopes":["Personal"]}],"industries":["Other"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-07-14T21:23:37.4952757+00:00","shortDescription":"Online booking and scheduling bot for the workplace.","longDescription":"Roby Meetings is an online booking and scheduling bot that seamlessly integrates with your calendar to simplify meetings & room booking.

WeDecide provides organizations a simple and structured way to create and collaborate on team decisions in Microsoft Teams by introducing decision cards. Decision cards help moving decisions out of conference calls and remove the need to email back and forth on team decisions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    Increase team engagement and never again miss a decision deadline. You can use WeDecide for example to decide on budget plans, dinner plans or new hires. Your decision data does not leave your company: all the relevant data gets saved inside your companies SharePoint, so you don’t have to worry about sensitive data.\r\n    \r\n     \r\n    \r\n    Easily create decision cards:\r\n    One team member creates a decision card by entering title, a description and implications for both approval and rejection. To provide additional information users can add document attachments like PDF, Word or Excel to guide the decision voters in making their vote. After creation, a bot informs users about the new decision and reminds them of deadlines, so decision making get accelerated.\r\n    \r\n     \r\n    \r\n    Decide within your team:\r\n    After installation, WeDecide gets added to a team as it's own tab. Decision cards can be create from here. You can delete old decisions or update their status to prevent users to vote on an already resolved decisions. After you created a decision the WeDecide chatbot pushes a notification to all respective voters, that a new decision has been created. The information provides them with a link so that the decision card can be reviewed inside MS Teams. Once a voter decided, the decision creator gets a notification from the chatbot telling him that someone voted on his decision. After a voter has decided, he will see the other votes underneath his vote within the decision card. This makes it easy to understand who has voted. It is only displayed after voting, so no one gets influenced in decisions from other voters.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/1ab18880-61ec-11ea-96be-55673711cb47_largeImage.png?v=1.1.6","accentColor":"#6CDA91","id":"1ab18880-61ec-11ea-96be-55673711cb47","name":"We

It means that data leaves the user’s side already secured by advanced encryption algorithms.\n\n- Exclude Email content and attachments from transferring via Email by SMTP.\n\n- Manage access rights to the Email content and attachments, allow to revoke Emails or any data.\n\n- Encrypt Email content and attachments separately. Transfer and store data encrypted.\n\n- Check user identity and apply company’s policies on executed actions.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/1ed0a549-c730-44c7-a984-a8c658fe9807_largeImage.png?v=1.4.104","accentColor":"#FFFFFF","id":"1ed0a549-c730-44c7-a984-a8c658fe9807","name":"StealthMail","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/1ed0a549-c730-44c7-a984-a8c658fe9807_smallImage.png?v=1.4.104"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"1f36eaf6-30a3-4488-a73f-4754b91e865d","appId":"1f36eaf6-30a3-4488-a73f-4754b91e865d","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200001583","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/1f36eaf6-30a3-4488-a73f-4754b91e865d/1.png?v=1.0.0","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/1f36eaf6-30a3-4488-a73f-4754b91e865d/2.png?v=1.0.0","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/1f36eaf6-30a3-4488-a73f-4754b91e865d/3.png?v=1.0.0"],"manifestVersion":"1.6","version":"1.0.0","categories":["DataVisualizationAndBI","Productivity"],"developerName":"askR.ai","developerUrl":"https://en.askr.ai/","privacyUrl":"https://en.askr.ai/privacy-policy-askr-ai","termsOfUseUrl":"https://en.askr.ai/terms-of-use-askr-ai","validDomains":["en.askr.ai","fr1.askr.ai","askr.ai"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"bots":[{"id":"1f36eaf6-30a3-4488-a73f-4754b91e865d","scopes":["Personal"],"commandLists":[{"scopes":["Personal"],"commands":[{"title":"help me","description":"help me"}]}],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"staticTabs":[{"entityId":"1","name":"Find more","contentUrl":"https://en.askr.ai/microsoft-teams-store","websiteUrl":"https://en.askr.ai/microsoft-teams-store","scopes":["Personal"]}],"showLoadingIndicator":false,"mpnId":"5353738","industries":["Other"],"keywords":["analytics","data assistant","database"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-05-09T09:26:00.5074814+00:00","securityComplianceInfo":{"status":"Attested","mcasId":"36145"},"shortDescription":"Chat with your data ! askR.ai is an AI-based assistant to answer your questions.","longDescription":"You have the data but you don’t like the technical process to access them ?\nLet askR.ai searches the information you need.

Send simple, easy to understand, unobtrusive engagement questions to team members.\n2. Collect engagement levels, anonymously, from team members via emoji.\nTurn these engagement levels into high granularity statistics for your organization.\n3.Provide analytics to you, the leader, highlighting problem areas within your organization.\n\nHappyTeams helps team members by allowing them to anonymously communicate their issues in an organization with their leaders. Anonymous, randomised questions are sent to users every day, or every two days, depending on your organisation settings. This is done through simply clicking an emoji to answer a question, and this app only sends notifications to users.\n\nAs a team member, there's no need to think about your answer, just read the question and react, anonymously, that's it! Simple!

It empowers them to manage real-time agent conversations directly from their Teams client. \nAlthough Anywhere365 is designed to automate agent adherence and guidance as much as possible,  supervisors may want to take an active role in regularly monitoring agent conversations for coaching, quality assurance and compliance purposes. For contact centers or help desks that use Anywhere365 with Microsoft Teams as their unified communications (UC) platform, the Anywhere365 InDialogue Bot provides supervisors with silent monitor, coaching (whisper) and call barge capabilities all from their standard Teams client. \nEmbedded within the standard Teams Client, the Anywhere365 InDialogue Bot presents supervisors with a list of commands to initiate call monitoring features. The listcalls command provides a list of active calls in the Unified Contact Center (UCC) that the supervisor manages. Once they select a call from the list, the supervisor is presented with an Active Call Control card with four options: Listen, Whisper, Speak and Take over. \nThe listen function allows the supervisor to silently monitor the conversation, without the other participants (customer and agent) hearing the supervisor. This functionality is useful for quality monitoring and compliance purposes. \nWith the whisper feature, the supervisor joins the conversation; however, only the agent can hear the supervisor. This functionality is useful for providing real-time coaching and support during conversations. \nThe speak function allows the supervisor to join the conversation as a full participant where both the customer and agent can hear the supervisor. The conversation becomes a three-party conference, where the supervisor can provide active support to the agent for an improved customer experience. \nWith the take over option, the supervisor conferences into the call and takes over the role of the agent. The original agent will still be in the conversation but muted. The other participants (customer and supervisor) cannot hear the agent, however the agent can hear them. This feature is typically used for agent training purposes, or when a supervisor needs to take control of a conversation that has become problematic for any reason. \nPlease take note that the calling feature in Microsoft Teams is only available in the Teams Desktop client and in the Teams Web client when using Microsoft Edge. The InDialogue Bot supports other browsers when the address is set to any phone number or Skype for Business SIP address. \nThe InDialogue Bot requires an Anywhere365 Corporate, Enterprise or Enterprise Plus license. Please visit our website (https://anywhere365.io) to learn more about how the Anywhere365 Contact Center and Dialogue Management platform can empower your business, just like it has done for hundreds of other customers.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/23b30d71-7f7b-4e06-96a6-845df435c7af_largeImage.png?v=1.0.14","accentColor":"#027CFF","id":"23b30d71-7f7b-4e06-96a6-845df435c7af","name":"Anywhere365 InDialogue","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/23b30d71-7f7b-4e06-96a6-845df435c7af_smallImage.png?v=1.0.14"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"2405e655-76fa-4104-b4b8-e4fb525d0f1a","appId":"2405e655-76fa-4104-b4b8-e4fb525d0f1a","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA104382012","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/2405e655-76fa-4104-b4b8-e4fb525d0f1a/1.jpeg?v=1.0.17","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/2405e655-76fa-4104-b4b8-e4fb525d0f1a/2.jpeg?v=1.0.17","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/2405e655-76fa-4104-b4b8-e4fb525d0f1a/3.jpeg?v=1.0.17","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/2405e655-76fa-4104-b4b8-e4fb525d0f1a/4.jpeg?v=1.0.17","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/2405e655-76fa-4104-b4b8-e4fb525d0f1a/5.jpeg?v=1.0.17"],"manifestVersion":"1.3","version":"1.0.17","categories":["HumanResourcesAndRecruiting","Productivity"],"developerName":"ADP","developerUrl":"https://www.adp.com","privacyUrl":"https://www.adp.com/privacy.aspx","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.adp.com/legal.aspx","validDomains":["*.adp.com"],"permissions":[],"bots":[{"id":"2405e655-76fa-4104-b4b8-e4fb525d0f1a","scopes":["Personal"],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"galleryTabs":[],"staticTabs":[{"entityId":"Help","name":"Help","contentUrl":"https://adpapps.adp.com/teams/help","websiteUrl":"https://adpapps.adp.com/teams/help","scopes":["Personal"]}],"industries":["Other"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-01-25T22:18:08.7813226+00:00","shortDescription":"Enable your employees to access their own workforce info without leaving Teams.","longDescription":"With ADP Virtual Assistant, companies using ADP for payroll and Microsoft Teams for internal collaboration can give their employees convenient access to their own workplace information - directly within Teams.

The tool provides the teacher with an overview of all stored documents and allows them to link each plan to their class calendar. This provides easy navigation to the resources needed each day, reducing the time spent searching for documents at the start of each lesson, thus easing workflow and saving time. An intelligent search function also helps teachers and students to easily locate plans and related documents.\nTeachers can copy plans and documents across teams to re-use and share with others. They can also choose to share documents with the class for students to view and download from the plans.\nTeachers also have an overview of planning across all their classes and channels, including a calendar and a smart search across classes.\nThe Beedle class list provides teachers with an overview of all students in their class which they can export to Excel or Word. The class list includes functionality for the teachers to randomly pick a student and to split the class into random groups. These tools also provide some pedagogical features such as excluding certain students from being randomly chosen and the option to manually change group compositions. The group lists can also be exported to Excel or Word.\nTeachers can use the Beedle diary to make quick comments about students and tag them with a customised category. Comments can be made private or shared with other teachers or the students themselves. The diary provides teachers with a valuable overview of comments in a class or per student which can be filtered and exported.\nBeing developed specifically for Microsoft Teams, Beedle makes it easy for users to work in a familiar environment where they can instantly start planning, use the class list or enter comments into the diary. Beedle follows Microsoft guidelines and ensures colleagues can seamlessly collaborate and thus improve school efficiency.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/361ee822-e020-4e06-afb5-71e60a85fd53_largeImage.png?v=1.3.3","accentColor":"#FFFFFF","id":"361ee822-e020-4e06-afb5-71e60a85fd53","name":"Beedle","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/361ee822-e020-4e06-afb5-71e60a85fd53_smallImage.png?v=1.3.3"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"36abb89d-bb3d-4eef-bb25-e23c2a1c8c0f","appId":"36abb89d-bb3d-4eef-bb25-e23c2a1c8c0f","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200002552","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/36abb89d-bb3d-4eef-bb25-e23c2a1c8c0f/1.png?v=1.0.6"],"manifestVersion":"1.8","version":"1.0.6","categories":["Utilities","Productivity","Education"],"developerName":"Konverion UG","developerUrl":"https://www.konverion.de","privacyUrl":"https://www.konverion.de/hildeprivacy.html","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.konverion.de/hildeterms.html","validDomains":[],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"bots":[{"id":"13358935-0394-405c-b9e0-8e455823bb11","scopes":["Personal"],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"supportedLanguages":["de"],"mpnId":"6173724","industries":["Education"],"keywords":["Office365","Hilde","Betriebsrat"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2021-03-02T15:32:47.5033696+00:00","shortDescription":"Hilde! gibt Antworten zu Begriffen aus Microsoft 365","longDescription":"Gerade als Betriebsrat ist man bei Microsoft 365 mit einer Unzahl neuer Begrifflichkeiten konfrontiert.

Well, **RemindMyself** is a bot and messaging extension that lets you remind yourself of posts at a future time. It helps your remember and follow up on short tasks, you just type your command _in plain English_! No need to load up your task or calendar app - everything is doable inside Teams!\n\nYou can tell **RemindMyself** to set reminders.  To set a reminder, just give **RemindMyself** a time and an optional message. For example:\n* \"4pm\" -> This will set a reminder for 4pm\n* \"in 3 minutes call my boss\" -> Reminder in 3 minutes\n* \"do my taxes tomorrow evening\" -> Reminder tomorrow evening\n* \"April 1, send out the joke email\" -> Reminder on April 1\n* \"Thursday night do my performance review\" -> Perf review Thursday night :)\n\nWhen the reminder fires, you will get a message from the bot.  You can read it, jump to the linked message, or snooze it!\n\nSome features:\n* You can type your command in the command box at the top of Teams\n* You can converse with the bot directly to manage reminders\n* You can @mention the bot in a channel (be a little passive aggressive :) ).\n* You can set a \"Quick Reminder\" from a message context menu!\n\nAll reminders fire for you privately. **RemindMyself** will not send any messages to any channels or anyone else. Although here's a special bonus:\n* if you @mention a person in a message to this bot, they will also get the reminder (this only works in channels or group chats)\n\nThis way you can remind both yourself and a colleague of important tasks.\n\nUse **RemindMyself** to manage your personal and professional life, all from Teams itself!\n\n","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/3790e65b-d696-4523-b938-e85a0ff120e2_largeImage.png?v=1.0.1","accentColor":"#235EA5","id":"3790e65b-d696-4523-b938-e85a0ff120e2","name":"RemindMyself","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/3790e65b-d696-4523-b938-e85a0ff120e2_smallImage.png?v=1.0.1"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"383cc171-22d5-4df5-87d0-6c656ddcff32","appId":"383cc171-22d5-4df5-87d0-6c656ddcff32","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200002393","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/383cc171-22d5-4df5-87d0-6c656ddcff32/1.png?v=1.0.0"],"manifestVersion":"1.8","version":"1.0.0","categories":["TrainingAndTutorial","Education"],"developerName":"Fifty","developerUrl":"https://app.fifty.do/","privacyUrl":"https://app.fifty.do/PrivacyPolicy.pdf","termsOfUseUrl":"https://app.fifty.do/CGUV.pdf","validDomains":[],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"bots":[{"id":"6c40646b-044d-4ebe-9416-b4ef58403802","scopes":["Personal","Team"],"commandLists":[{"scopes":["Personal"],"commands":[{"title":"help","description":"More information about Fifty bot"}]},{"scopes":["Team"],"commands":[{"title":"help","description":"More information about Fifty bot"}]}],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"supportedLanguages":["en-us","fr"],"mpnId":"6284963","industries":["Education"],"keywords":["edoing","fifty","thefiftyapp"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-11-24T15:28:56.1134574+00:00","shortDescription":"Fifty - Stop talking.

But because BrainBot’s unique Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform, BrainBot can ask purposeful questions that use text, video, interactive polls, and more, to fully engage the learner’s brain and lead to greater knowledge retention. \n\nBrainBot boosters are available free with many Bigger Brains courses, or Teachers can customize BrainBot for use in their own classes by signing up at https://brainbot.ai.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/3c95872f-ca12-456e-84b9-c717fe93330c_largeImage.png?v=1.9.1","accentColor":"#FFFFFF","id":"3c95872f-ca12-456e-84b9-c717fe93330c","name":"BrainBot","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/3c95872f-ca12-456e-84b9-c717fe93330c_smallImage.png?v=1.9.1"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"3c9fd7ca-5386-4179-9bb7-7fcdcc373017","appId":"3c9fd7ca-5386-4179-9bb7-7fcdcc373017","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200001604","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/3c9fd7ca-5386-4179-9bb7-7fcdcc373017/1.png?v=1.0.2","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/3c9fd7ca-5386-4179-9bb7-7fcdcc373017/2.png?v=1.0.2","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/3c9fd7ca-5386-4179-9bb7-7fcdcc373017/3.png?v=1.0.2","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/3c9fd7ca-5386-4179-9bb7-7fcdcc373017/4.png?v=1.0.2"],"manifestVersion":"1.6","version":"1.0.2","categories":["Communication","ContentManagement","Productivity"],"developerName":"Move Work Forward","developerUrl":"https://www.moveworkforward.com","privacyUrl":"https://www.moveworkforward.com/privacy-policy","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.moveworkforward.com/license-agreement/eula","validDomains":[],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"bots":[{"id":"7c82be72-f9fb-44c9-930f-8064cd849d7d","scopes":["Personal","Team","GroupChat"],"commandLists":[{"scopes":["Personal"],"commands":[{"title":"Learn more","description":"Find out what I can do"},{"title":"Connect","description":"Connect Microsoft Teams with Confluence"}]},{"scopes":["Team"],"commands":[{"title":"Learn more","description":"Find out what I can do"}]},{"scopes":["GroupChat"],"commands":[{"title":"Learn more","description":"Find out what I can do"}]}],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"inputExtensions":[{"botId":"7c82be72-f9fb-44c9-930f-8064cd849d7d","canUpdateConfiguration":false,"scopes":["Team","Personal"],"commands":[{"id":"search","context":["Commandbox","Compose"],"initialRun":true,"parameters":[{"name":"text","title":"Enter text to search Confluence","description":"What do you want to find in Confluence?"}],"title":"Search","description":"Search Confluence and insert results"}],"messageHandlers":[{"value":{"domains":["*.atlassian.net"]}}]}],"showLoadingIndicator":false,"mpnId":"6179252","industries":["Other"],"keywords":["confluence cloud ","confluence integration","confluence server"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-06-02T06:53:24.4132307+00:00","shortDescription":"The ultimate integration of Atlassian Confluence with Microsoft Teams","longDescription":"Integrate Atlassian Confluence with Microsoft Teams to \\\n- not miss important content updates by configuring global, space, content or personal notifications \\\n- enrich information in Microsoft Teams about Confluence content \\\n- interact with a piece of Confluence content or a comment directly from Microsoft Teams \\\n- search a piece of content in Confluence from Microsoft Teams and insert it in your conversations \\\n- provide additional context with inserted actionable cards \\\n- unfurl Confluence Cloud links to provide additional context to your conversations. \\\n\\\n\nThis is a companion app to Microsoft Teams Confluence Connector available at Atlassian Marketplace https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1216348/microsoft-teams-confluence-connector?hosting=cloud&tab=overview.\n\n*A bit more details about the notifications and alerts.* \\\nConfluence administrator can setup global rules with multiple filters that are: space filters, user filters, page and label filters. \\\nSpace administrators can create rules only for the space where they are admins. \\\nContent notifications can be setup against a blog post or a page. \\\nPersonal notifications can help you stay on top of the content you have created. \\\n\\\n*User needs to have an active Atlassian account in order to use this app properly.

An educator creates questions with multiple answer options and submits them into the quiz form. (To create quizzes, they can use a Microsoft Teams account.)\n  2.  At a given time, the educator opens the quiz for joining, students join the quiz on their mobile devices, and the educator launches the quiz.\n  3.  All participants answer questions simultaneously and get points for correct and quick answers. A player can see whether their answer is correct right away.\n  4.  A leaderboard is demonstrated after each question, so everyone can see the competition. The final leaderboard shows the winners who have got the most points..\n\nHow can an educator leverage online quizzes?\n  5.   A smartphone can be a distraction at the class. Online quizzes, on the opposite, use smartphones for educational benefits. The youth loves techy gadgets and competition — turn their passion into learning!\n  6.  Online quizzes make an efficient tool to check knowledge. The less time it takes to answer, the more points the player gets. In this situation there is no time to look for answers, so only real knowledge helps win.\n  7.  As opposed to paper tests that require grading, testing knowledge in the form of an online quiz saves the educator’s time. \n  8.  Learning is more efficient when attention is switched from verbal explanation to quizzes and back, using the learner’s visual memory.\n\nWhat benefits does myQuiz offer as a quiz platform?\n● To create and run a quiz, you only need a device and an internet connection. No downloading and installing any software. \n● An educator can create their own quizzes in a range of subjects: science, history, arts, and many others.\n● One can use videos and images to illustrate their questions: for example, graphic problems, formulas and equations, geographical maps, artworks, and so on.\n● Time to answer can be adjusted accordingly, offering your audience easy questions for quick answers, or complex quizzes that require understanding.\n● A quiz can be paused at any time, allowing the educator to explain the subject or initiate a discussion, and then get back to the quiz.\n● The questions can have explanations that will be shown after the answer is given. \n● It is easy to make a quiz regardless of the amount of your players — the platform can hold small quizzes as well as thousands of players if you decide to use it at a large event for entertaining.\n\n  1.  Create your own quizzes. Try any topic: Science, Mathematics, Language. Create simple or complex quizzes based on your audience. \n  2.  Add your own images and videos for questions: for example, formulas, photos of artwork, or historical persons, and more. \n  3.  Set time limits for answering questions. Conduct fast quizzes that require fast reactions, or complex quizzes to test the audience's understanding of a subject. \n  4.  Pause your quiz and tell your audience more, or initiate a discussion, and then get back to your quiz. \n  5.  Add an explanation for any question which will be shown to your players along with a correct answer. \n  6.  Increase the audience’s attention by switching between explanations and the quiz.  \n\nMake learning more interesting and efficient with myQuiz, the ultimate edutainment platform!","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/4085da2b-3b84-43ac-b895-dd9ec865a6cc_largeImage.png?v=1.0.5","accentColor":"#4948BD","id":"4085da2b-3b84-43ac-b895-dd9ec865a6cc","name":"myQuiz","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/4085da2b-3b84-43ac-b895-dd9ec865a6cc_smallImage.png?v=1.0.5"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"40906836-4323-4bbe-875e-3cbb134c40a2","appId":"40906836-4323-4bbe-875e-3cbb134c40a2","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200001679","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/40906836-4323-4bbe-875e-3cbb134c40a2/1.png?v=1.0.9","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/40906836-4323-4bbe-875e-3cbb134c40a2/2.png?v=1.0.9","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/40906836-4323-4bbe-875e-3cbb134c40a2/3.png?v=1.0.9","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/40906836-4323-4bbe-875e-3cbb134c40a2/4.png?v=1.0.9"],"manifestVersion":"1.5","version":"1.0.9","categories":["Communication","ContentManagement","Productivity"],"developerName":"OOO RD17","developerUrl":"https://rd17.org","privacyUrl":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQHouhjK2Qof_NKFVucpN44PO30SFZHDfxWhu-u5wlZI56UW7v3bT-WCM4zH4ZaWGzQR7lnoUpVyU1S/pub","termsOfUseUrl":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTMQNAdgN7xy6n9tNvhDe8Sb2AF8A9v8jfG3gJ503cXzIq1nr_Zbq5aShN0mU49fvADgKZ8a58Oha-C/pub","validDomains":["*.perfectwiki.xyz","perfectwiki.xyz"],"permissions":["Identity"],"galleryTabs":[{"configurationUrl":"https://app.perfectwiki.xyz/config","scopes":["Team"]}],"mpnId":"6185119","industries":["Other"],"keywords":["copy wiki","wiki","export wiki"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-06-09T09:05:04.8875643+00:00","shortDescription":"Feature Rich Wiki for Microsoft Teams","longDescription":"Perfect Wiki is a simple wiki for organizing and sharing your team's collective knowledge.

Microsoft did a great job unifying communication tools and project management with the advantages of Office 365. Nevertheless, there is something what can take the user experience to a whole new level!\n\nPeople working on common projects using Microsoft Teams as the collaboration application still have to connect to different data repositories from time to time if they would like to share information with their team members. There are important details in emails, files located on the file servers and SharePoint, there are messages and files relevant for the team which are years old and can be found only in the archive. All of them can be important in the project you are working on. It can be very time consuming and difficult to find all these documents and share them with your team. But there is a solution! \n\nThe contentACCESS Teams app connects your essential IT-systems with Microsoft Teams. With a few simple clicks you can attach to any conversation:\n* emails from all accessible mailboxes,\n* files from your workstation and file servers,\n* Microsoft SharePoint,\n* any other sources connected to contentACCESS.\n\nThe powerful search engine of contentACCESS makes finding all relevant emails and documents an easy task.

Genea access control is engineered for building management teams and designed for the convenience of busy companies.\nGenea integrates with Microsoft Teams to act as a physical security incident management platform. Access control hardware must be installed in order for customers to make use of the Microsoft Teams integration. When the hardware detects certain events occurring on a property, it is logged in the Genea software and if the event meets certain criteria, it will send a notification to the customer via Microsoft Teams.\nHere’s how Genea + Microsoft Teams integration can keep your physical security operation running smoothly: \n\n1. Audit Log Notifications – Genea can notify you via Microsoft Teams when changes are made to your access system, including when users are created or deactivated, keys are issued or revoked, or changes are made to schedules or door groups, etc.\n2. Access Control Notifications – Genea can notify you via Microsoft Teams when important events occur on your property such as Card Access Denied, Controller Offline issues, AC Power Failure, Battery Backup Failure, Held Open Alarms, Door Forced Alarms, etc.\n3. Visitor Log Notifications – Genea can notify you via Microsoft Teams when visitors check in at your property\nBenefits :\n\n1. Reduces the amount of time your team spends monitoring video feeds and sifting through access logs.\n2. Get notified instantly when security events occur so you can take action immediately, rather than pour through logs to find out what happened after the fact.\n3. Show auditors that your lean team has everything under control and reduce those precious billable hours during an compliance audit.\n\nVisit us at https://www.getgenea.com.\nContact Support at acsupport@getgenea.com or you can get started by requesting a demo at https://www.getgenea.com/landings/demo-request","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/47eab277-6add-4a9f-859f-d873480932af_largeImage.png?v=2.0.0","accentColor":"#009CDE","id":"47eab277-6add-4a9f-859f-d873480932af","name":"Genea","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/47eab277-6add-4a9f-859f-d873480932af_smallImage.png?v=2.0.0"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"484aa99e-4b6b-4182-8c89-3ae4f85f0cd6","appId":"484aa99e-4b6b-4182-8c89-3ae4f85f0cd6","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200002622","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/484aa99e-4b6b-4182-8c89-3ae4f85f0cd6/1.png?v=1.0.1","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/484aa99e-4b6b-4182-8c89-3ae4f85f0cd6/2.png?v=1.0.1","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/484aa99e-4b6b-4182-8c89-3ae4f85f0cd6/3.png?v=1.0.1","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/484aa99e-4b6b-4182-8c89-3ae4f85f0cd6/4.png?v=1.0.1","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/484aa99e-4b6b-4182-8c89-3ae4f85f0cd6/5.png?v=1.0.1"],"videoUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-dNNpU1_P8","manifestVersion":"1.7","version":"1.0.1","categories":["Communication","TrainingAndTutorial","HumanResourcesAndRecruiting","Education"],"developerName":"My-Serious-Game","developerUrl":"https://www.edmill.com/","privacyUrl":"https://app.edmill.com/privacy-policy","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.edmill.com/cgu/","validDomains":["app.edmill.com","api.edmill.com","login.microsoftonline.com"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"staticTabs":[{"entityId":"dashboard","name":"Dashboard","contentUrl":"https://app.edmill.com/dashboard","websiteUrl":"https://app.edmill.com","scopes":["Personal"]},{"entityId":"training_programs","name":"Training Programs","contentUrl":"https://app.edmill.com/training_programs","websiteUrl":"https://app.edmill.com","scopes":["Personal"]},{"entityId":"results","name":"Results","contentUrl":"https://app.edmill.com/results","websiteUrl":"https://app.edmill.com","scopes":["Personal"]},{"entityId":"library","name":"Library","contentUrl":"https://app.edmill.com/library","websiteUrl":"https://app.edmill.com","scopes":["Personal"]},{"entityId":"profile","name":"My profile","contentUrl":"https://app.edmill.com/profile","websiteUrl":"https://app.edmill.com","scopes":["Personal"]}],"webApplicationInfo":{"id":"484aa99e-4b6b-4182-8c89-3ae4f85f0cd6","resource":"api://app.edmill.com/484aa99e-4b6b-4182-8c89-3ae4f85f0cd6"},"supportedLanguages":["en","fr"],"mpnId":"6124008","industries":["Education","ProfessionalServices"],"keywords":["vocational training","e-learning","online courses"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2021-03-17T09:31:35.8051243+00:00","shortDescription":"EdMill - Transform, Train, Perform","longDescription":"Learn and follow-up on your online courses, 100% digital, 0% compromise on quality.\nEdMill is the Mill of digital Education.

Teams.\n\nHere's how the Gtmhub app works:\nThe Gtmhub bot will send you a personal KR update reminder when it's time to update your KRs. And you can update your KRs right there and then, all without leaving Teams! How great is that? \n\nIt gets even better. The experience of updating is exactly the same as in your Gtmhub account. It's never been easier to post an update.\n\nYou will also receive a personal reminder a day before the due date of your Gtmhub tasks. That way, nothing important you wanted to do will get away unnoticed. You can focus on being successful, and leave the admin work to the Gtmhub app.\n\nDid we mention the Hub tab? You can access the default Gtmhub screen either by installing the Gtmhub app or by adding the Tab. The exprience will be restricted only to the Hub, so you can stay focused on what you are doing. There's no notifications in the Hub tab, just pure OKR experience.\n\nLast but not least, viewing your OKRs and sharing them in channels has never been quicker with an easy search. Just type @gtmhub followed by the name of your OKR. You are able to post an objective with all its details on progress and key results, or a specific key result with all its details around progress and its target.\n\nWe're always eager to hear from you and make improvements to our app and the Gtmhub experience. Please don't hesitate to reach out in our live chat, and stay tuned for more updates.\n*About Gtmhub*\nGtmhub is the world's most beautiful and intuitive Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) management and employee experience solution. We build enterprise-scale software with a consumer-grade experience.\nTo make use of the Gtmhub Teams integration, you need a trial account in Gtmhub or a paid subscription.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/5fdd80e2-4d58-4c5c-ac85-356c1b2a0bba_largeImage.png?v=1.1.0","accentColor":"#FFFFFF","id":"5fdd80e2-4d58-4c5c-ac85-356c1b2a0bba","name":"Gtmhub","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/5fdd80e2-4d58-4c5c-ac85-356c1b2a0bba_smallImage.png?v=1.1.0"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"601a47bc-f201-4398-a0cb-593ea081f265","appId":"601a47bc-f201-4398-a0cb-593ea081f265","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200001849","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/601a47bc-f201-4398-a0cb-593ea081f265/1.png?v=1.0.0","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/601a47bc-f201-4398-a0cb-593ea081f265/2.png?v=1.0.0","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/601a47bc-f201-4398-a0cb-593ea081f265/3.png?v=1.0.0"],"manifestVersion":"1.7","version":"1.0.0","categories":["Communication","HumanResourcesAndRecruiting","Social"],"developerName":"Semos Cloud Soultions","developerUrl":"https://semoscloud.com/","privacyUrl":"https://semoscloud.com/privacy-policy/","termsOfUseUrl":"https://semoscloud.com/terms-of-use/","validDomains":[],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"bots":[{"id":"f2a547b7-4289-4823-9497-99e8453b5664","scopes":["Team","GroupChat","Personal"],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"mpnId":"6136826","industries":["Other"],"keywords":["semoscloud","jobpts","recognition"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-07-09T08:06:10.9765125+00:00","shortDescription":"Appreciate Your Employees & Create Moments that Matter","longDescription":"What is JobPts?\n\nJobPts enables employers to enrich their company culture and provide extraordinary employee experience by showing appreciation that employees deserve.\nWhat are the reasons for recognizing someone through JobPts?\nAs part of the Recognition process, JobPts will provide the technological tools to enable company’s HR group to build, maintain and grow with their specific recognition and rewarding programs.

Most importantly this creates an innovation pull from the team level, rather than attempting to push change from the top of the organisation. \n\nThe system also creates powerful visibility for senior leaders across the entire organisation. Teamgage allows them to understand how well the organisation is executing on their vision and where pockets of innovation can be incubated. \n\nTeamgage is used by companies throughout the world in industries that include banking and finance, energy and resources, technology and innovation, elite sport, real estate, infrastructure, utilities and aged care.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/61aa6197-4b01-4bb4-a7a6-6ecf477654a0_largeImage.png?v=1.0.0","accentColor":"#353535","id":"61aa6197-4b01-4bb4-a7a6-6ecf477654a0","name":"Teamgage","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/61aa6197-4b01-4bb4-a7a6-6ecf477654a0_smallImage.png?v=1.0.0"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"62554c36-4756-4d4e-b8fb-f4b24875ae0c","appId":"62554c36-4756-4d4e-b8fb-f4b24875ae0c","item":{"manifestVersion":"1.7","version":"1.0","categories":["Education","Microsoft"],"developerName":"Microsoft Corporation","developerUrl":"https://www.microsoft.com/education","privacyUrl":"https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement","thirdPartyNoticesUrl":"https://contentstorage.osi.office.net/onenoteassignmentsui/third-party-notices.txt","validDomains":["assignments.onenote.com"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"devicePermissions":["Media"],"staticTabs":[{"entityId":"gradebook","name":"Grades","contentUrl":"https://assignments.onenote.com/gradebook?isTeamsFrame=true&tenantId={tid}&groupId={groupId}&userId={userObjectId}&userRole={userLicenseType}&hostClientType={hostClientType}&locale={locale}&sessionId={sessionId}&subEntityId={subEntityId}&theme={theme}&trackingId={appSessionId}","scopes":["Team"]}],"isFullScreen":true,"isFullTrust":true,"mobileModules":[{"id":"cfdb1d84-6b60-4e99-832a-6e1316ac72df","type":"Web","title":"Grades","targetSdkVersion":"1.0.0","webModuleUrl":"https://assignments.onenote.com/gradebook?isTeamsFrame=true&tenantId={tid}&groupId={groupId}&userId={userObjectId}&userRole={userLicenseType}&hostClientType={hostClientType}&locale={locale}&sessionId={sessionId}&subEntityId={subEntityId}&isMobileModule=true&theme={theme}&trackingId={appSessionId}","icons":{"default":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/MobileModuleIcons/Assignments/128x128-line.png?v=1.1","selected":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/MobileModuleIcons/Assignments/128x128-fill.png?v=1.1"}}],"supportedLanguages":["en-us","ar","bg","ca","cs","cy","da","de","el","es","et","fi","fr","he","hi","hr","hu","id","is","it","ja","ka","ko","lt","lv","nb","nl","nn","pl","pt","pt-br","ro","ru","sk","sl","sr","sv","th","tr","uk","vi","zh-cn","zh-hans","zh-hant","zh-tw"],"shortDescription":"Grading and feedback experience for classes","longDescription":"Grades is a tool for teachers to track and review student work.

If you do have a permanent hearing or vision impairment, Microsoft tools can support your style of working. You may have situational or temporary accessibility needs. For instance, being stuck in a noisy environment and needing live captions during an online meeting. Or perhaps you're juggling work and childcare and could benefit from blurring your background.\n\nThe accessibility bot currently has knowledge to support with hearing, mental health, mobility, neurodiversity and vision needs.

We’ve been working to streamline the user experience with our product in different channels. As a result, we’ve released an app for Microsoft Teams that enables Kahoot! users to assign challenges and play live games to teach or present. Below are the functionalities available within the app:\n\nAccess your kahoots:\nAfter installing and providing your credentials to the Kahoot! app, your kahoots will appear under the newly discoverable My Kahoots tab. Here you’ll be able to launch a live game or assign a challenge.\n\nLaunch a live game:\nBy select the kahoot you would like to play as a live game under the Kahoot tab you can choose to play a live game by clicking Present or Play. \n\nAssign a challenge:\nAssign a challenge directly within your Microsoft Teams’s group by selecting the kahoot you would like to assign as a challenge under the Kahoot tab. A confirmation will verify you’ve launched your challenge in the channel. The kahoot assignment will be sent to the channel, where everybody in the channel can click and join.\n\nChallenge in team space:\nMembers in the channel can click ‘Open assignment’ to complete the assignment within Microsoft Teams. The channel will receive notification after 25%, 50%, 75% of the time limit has passed, as well as when the assignment ends, or, if the assignment time limit is less than 24 hours, at 50% and when the assignment ends.\n\nFinal leaderboard & report:\nWhen the assignment ends, a message will be sent to the channel with a button to open the podium - highlighting the top three participants - which anyone in the channel can open and view. If you’d like to view data from the kahoot assignment, a report will be linked directly from the podium for the host to review. \n\nInformation and support:\nFor more information please visit kahoot.com.

Manage support, customer service and projects.","longDescription":"Jira Server for Microsoft Teams brings your Jira Server experience into your collaboration environment, letting you and your team stay focused and communicate on issues and backlog. Interact with Jira Server bot for Microsoft Teams to: create, assign, watch, edit issues, log working time. You may also interact with the bot from your team channel. With the messaging extension, you can quickly search for a specific issue and submit it to a channel or conversation. With the actionable message, you can quickly create a new issue, pre-populated with message text as the issue description, or save the message as a comment on one of your Jira Server issues. Also, you can add your project backlog to your channel as a tab, so that your team could easily track and work on the issues within the tab. Important: To use messaging extension, bot, or tabs you’ll need to install Microsoft Teams for Jira Server add-on to your Jira Server. Make sure you have admin permissions within your Jira Server to be able to install and configure the add-on. In case you don't have admin permissions, please contact your Jira admin. Once the add-on is installed, the add-on will generate and assign a unique Jira ID to your Jira Server instance. Share the generated Jira ID with the team so that your teammates could connect Microsoft Teams to Jira. Jira Server connector for Microsoft Teams can be set up independently and doesn’t require add-on installation. Connector is using webhooks and can be configured directly from the Teams channel. Please note, that the webhook set-up in Jira requires Jira admin permissions. You will find the detailed instructions on the connector configuration page in Microsoft Teams. The detailed instructions on the configuration of Jira Server for Teams app you may find on our help page msteams-atlassian.com/JiraServer","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/6eacb5f0-68b0-46f0-9507-9e906c6861fc_largeImage.png?v=2020.09.25","accentColor":"#0052cc","id":"6eacb5f0-68b0-46f0-9507-9e906c6861fc","name":"Jira Server","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/6eacb5f0-68b0-46f0-9507-9e906c6861fc_smallImage.png?v=2020.09.25"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"6f62d397-8b16-48e9-9fea-1a5193c9fc08","appId":"6f62d397-8b16-48e9-9fea-1a5193c9fc08","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200000818","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/6f62d397-8b16-48e9-9fea-1a5193c9fc08/1.jpeg?v=1.3.0","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/6f62d397-8b16-48e9-9fea-1a5193c9fc08/2.jpeg?v=1.3.0"],"manifestVersion":"1.7","version":"1.3.0","categories":["ITAdmin"],"developerName":"Atlassian Opsgenie","developerUrl":"https://www.opsgenie.com","privacyUrl":"https://www.opsgenie.com/privacy","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.opsgenie.com/tos","validDomains":["*.opsgenie.com"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"bots":[{"id":"7cc3cece-d3e3-4b7a-85bf-5d19a56c6963","scopes":["Team"],"commandLists":[{"scopes":["Team"],"commands":[{"title":"ack [tiny-id]","description":"Acknowledge the alerts with IDs"},{"title":"snooze [tiny-id] for m/h/d","description":"Snooze the alerts with IDs for the specified time"},{"title":"note [note] to [tiny-id]","description":"Add note to the alerts with IDs"},{"title":"ackall/closeall","description":"Acknowledge/Close all open alerts"},{"title":"close [tiny-id]","description":"Close the alerts with IDs"},{"title":"exec [action-name] on [tiny-id]","description":"Execute the [action] on the alerts with IDs"},{"title":"get [tiny-id]","description":"Get details of the alert with ID"},{"title":"alert [msg] for [team1,user1...]","description":"Create an alert with the message for the specified recipients/teams"},{"title":"help","description":"Lists available commands for Opsgenie"},{"title":"connect","description":"Connect your Opsgenie account to your Microsoft Teams account"}]}],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"mpnId":"5410067","industries":["Other"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-11-02T11:57:17.6923647+00:00","shortDescription":"Execute commands on Opsgenie alerts within Microsoft Teams.","longDescription":"This bot is for executing commands on Opsgenie alerts.

Mithilfe von Textbausteinen lassen sich Mängel mühelos erfassen. Graphische Freihand-Notizen, ergänzte Objektaufnahmen und eine Verortung auf dem 2D-Plan verdeutlichen die tatsächliche Lage zweifelsfrei. Dadurch können die Partnerunternehmen schnell die entsprechenden Schwachstellen selbständig aufsuchen und beseitigen. Typische Anwendungen für den Service sind: technische Zustandsbegehungen, Abnahmen, Wohnungsübergaben, Sicherheitsbegehungen etc.\n\nBau-Fotos: In der modernen Arbeitswelt werden in zunehmendem Maße individuelle mobile Arbeitsmittel eingesetzt, insbesondere bei den Begehungen von Immobilien oder Bauvorhaben zur Erfassung aktueller Daten und Informationen direkt vor Ort. Der Zustand wird digital in Form von Bildern, Formularfeldern oder als Text erfasst und zur Weiterverarbeitung automatisiert über Internet weitergeleitet und damit bereitgestellt. Das spart wertvolle Zeit, minimiert mögliche Fehler, erhöht die Qualität der Arbeit und beschleunigt alle Folgeabläufe.\n\nBau-Tagesberichte: Mit dem Service wird die tägliche Protokollierung aller relevanten Informationen über den aktuellen Stand auf der Baustelle für den Anwender leicht und unproblematisch. Jeder Beteiligte bekommt einen Zugang zum Service und kann direkt vor Ort über ein mobiles Gerät oder im Büro am Laptop den Tagesbericht betrachten und diesen mit entsprechender Berechtigung erweitern, freigeben oder teilen.\n\nBau-Checklisten: Ein wichtiger Baustein des Qualitätsmanagements ist die Qualitätssicherung während der Bauausführung. Die QM-Checklisten werden digital abgebildet und die Erfassung des Ist-Zustands wird über ein mobiles Gerät erfolgen. Der Bediener bewertet das Bauelement und kontrolliert, ob die Ausführung in Ordnung ist oder nicht.

Zap is the virtual assistant created by Zapiens. Its artificial intelligence and its natural language processing mechanism allow it to generate an exponential, simple and intuitive knowledge system within your company, based on receiving questions and sending concise answers. Zap's operating flow is divided into five actions:  1. A person in your organization asks Zap a question.  2. Zap processes the question and searches for an answer in its database.  3. If Zap finds the answer: it sends it directly to the person who asked it.  4. If Zap does not have the answer in its database: it sends the question to an expert in your organization so that he/she can answer it.  5. Zap stores the new questions with their respective answers to expand and maintain a network of your company’s updated knowledge.  Using Zap in your organization will allow your professional teams to:  - Access contrasted and reliable information that interests them about a specific subject.  - Save time in finding concrete answers to specific problems.  - Identify professionals who have knowledge about specific issues of your company.  - Co-construct a solid knowledge base by taking advantage of the expert knowledge that each person in your organization has in a particular area.  - Streamline the connection between people and knowledge within your professional environment.

complicated project management and not enough about delivering a brilliant customer experience, Simple can help.\n\nIdeal for enterprise and government, Simple lets you centralise and streamline marketing operations. As well as cut costs, manage compliance and align strategic decision-making – across your multifaceted brands, products, campaigns and customer experiences.\n\nAt its heart, Simple gives marketing and comms leaders a single, holistic and real-time view of ever evolving campaigns, campaign budgets and campaign results – no matter how much activity you have in market.\n\nSimple breaks down silos so everyone on your marketing or comms team knows everything they need to know. You can easily see team capacity and allocate work, share up-to-date assets out of a single repository, and have a single source of truth and audit trail for approvals.\n\nFrom a marketing or comms leaders point of view, Simple is all about being able to spend just 15 minutes every morning to ‘take control’: see what’s smoothly on track, and what needs your urgent attention – whether it’s a matter of what you’re spending, who you’re targeting or whether your campaign activity matches your overall marketing strategy.\n\nAnd finally, the Power of Simple delivers real, measurable outcomes for marketing and comms teams:\n- Eliminate wasteful spending: One financial services customer used Simple to cut external advertising agency costs by 30%, by revealing hidden waste and redundancy and making significant process improvements.\n- Keep your brand’s global reputation intact: That same Simple customer – one of the world’s largest banks – increased marketing compliance from 67% to 100%, helping senior management sleep soundly at night.\n- Put productivity and staff wellbeing first: With new and better, easy-to-follow workflow processes, another Simple customer cut their marketing team’s workload by 5 hours per day – increasing energy and focus and de-stressing the work environment.\n\nSimple is designed for Microsoft Teams, so it’s fast to deploy and easy to learn for marketing and comms teams. And a shorter learning curve means you’re seeing real value from your investment much, much sooner.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/8bb3d336-4c08-4368-a79f-8c07d5d29d4b_largeImage.png?v=1.0.6","accentColor":"#5F41D2","id":"8bb3d336-4c08-4368-a79f-8c07d5d29d4b","name":"Simple Requests","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/8bb3d336-4c08-4368-a79f-8c07d5d29d4b_smallImage.png?v=1.0.6"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"8bbfbdb1-59dc-40a1-80cd-11e57ef97bcf","appId":"8bbfbdb1-59dc-40a1-80cd-11e57ef97bcf","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200001591","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/8bbfbdb1-59dc-40a1-80cd-11e57ef97bcf/1.png?v=1.0.4","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/8bbfbdb1-59dc-40a1-80cd-11e57ef97bcf/2.png?v=1.0.4"],"manifestVersion":"1.7","version":"1.0.4","categories":["Productivity","Social","Utilities"],"developerName":"Inyore","developerUrl":"https://www.inyore.com","privacyUrl":"https://www.inyore.com/privacypolicy","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.inyore.com/terms","validDomains":["www.inyore.com"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"devicePermissions":["Notifications"],"connectors":[{"connectorId":"a34ce5a7-3719-4f09-aaca-3aa8196e7716","scopes":["Team"],"configurationUrl":"https://www.inyore.com/teams/config"}],"mpnId":"6198008","industries":["Distribution","ProfessionalServices"],"keywords":["InyoreInc","Inyore","Anonymous messaging web platform"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-07-22T11:31:37.5371415+00:00","shortDescription":"Anonymous posts and build communities you care about","longDescription":"Inyore is a safe and secure social messaging platform where professionals speak their truth without fear and/or judgement to drive organizational change.

This allows multiple engineers to work on a single file, with the confidence of a clear change-by-change log. Users can also export their change log to PDF for a full view of all the changes and comments made to a model. The app will also allow engineers to open the most up to date version of the model in Structural 3D so they can make changes or review the model in closer detail.\n\nThe SkyCiv Microsoft Teams app helps teams become more efficient with their model management. No more will you have to send files across email, FTP or cloud servers. You can now review your team's models directly from Microsoft Team; allowing engineers to communicate and collaborate on models in real-time. This keeps your team in sync with the latest changes to your model, for a single source of truth.\n\nThe app is fully integrated with the SkyCiv cloud file manager. Users can import their structural models and files directly into Microsoft Teams with this app. The model will also include any comments made to the model from the SkyCiv platform. It also includes any information about previous versions or save comments; so your team can refer back to previous changes to the model.\n\nThe app can be installed at anytime from the Microsoft Teams Appstore. Users are then required to log into their SkyCiv account. From there they can search all their models to locate and select the model they wish to import into the Channel or Team. From here users can view the latest version of the model (via a full interactive 3D renderer) at anytime by refreshing the tab. The app adds the perfect compliment if you use project-based channels.\n\nThis app requires a SkyCiv Account to use. After the app is installed, users can load in a model from their cloud storage to view.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/9f4c66b2-fc15-44a7-a815-16db1d2bb87f_largeImage.png?v=1.0.0","accentColor":"#2785CC","id":"9f4c66b2-fc15-44a7-a815-16db1d2bb87f","name":"SkyCiv","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/9f4c66b2-fc15-44a7-a815-16db1d2bb87f_smallImage.png?v=1.0.0"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"9f826912-a565-4879-862f-fc97a3ca8d48","appId":"9f826912-a565-4879-862f-fc97a3ca8d48","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200001995","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/9f826912-a565-4879-862f-fc97a3ca8d48/1.png?v=1.2.5","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/9f826912-a565-4879-862f-fc97a3ca8d48/2.png?v=1.2.5","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/9f826912-a565-4879-862f-fc97a3ca8d48/3.png?v=1.2.5"],"manifestVersion":"1.7","version":"1.2.5","categories":["Communication","Productivity","WorkflowAndBusinessManagement"],"developerName":"Bookado sp. z o.o.","developerUrl":"https://bookado.io","privacyUrl":"https://bookado.io/Bookado_Privacy_Policy.pdf","termsOfUseUrl":"https://bookado.io/Bookado_Terms_of_Use.pdf","validDomains":["msteams.bookado.io"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"staticTabs":[{"entityId":"a9bb44a1-c261-4193-adab-9400e9c1102a","name":"Rooms","contentUrl":"https://msteams.bookado.io/home?resourceType=Room","scopes":["Personal"]},{"entityId":"b08406d0-20d7-4ad7-aabb-0b2f2b1c2a4c","name":"Desks","contentUrl":"https://msteams.bookado.io/home?resourceType=Desk","scopes":["Personal"]}],"webApplicationInfo":{"id":"79101529-c007-900a-d757-f685ca4524cb","resource":"api://msteams.bookado.io/79101529-c007-900a-d757-f685ca4524cb"},"mpnId":"6083854","industries":["Other"],"keywords":["reservation system rooms desks office"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-09-23T08:06:27.6459119+00:00","shortDescription":"Bookado helps to find and book a meeting room in your organization.","longDescription":"We often consider meeting room reservation as a trivial, unimportant action.

This can be a great challenge when we consider that people want to use different communication tools, share information in different ways and formats and need a solution that is available anywhere they are on whatever device.\n\nThe TeamViewer app works with the Microsoft Teams platform, that offers a plethora of different communication capabilities. It enables colleagues to connect with each other with remote device access and through AR connections beyond traditional chat, VoIP and video calls. This offers a powerful advantage when you “just need to see” what the problem is and trying to verbalize the issue is inefficient. AR connections especially are a must-have in cases where physical tasks are needed and you can ‘virtually’ point and draw in the user’s field of view to demonstrate in detail what to do.\n\nMoreover, the TeamViewer integration allows team members to bring all the artefacts they need to the Microsoft Teams hub including access to devices and environments needed to develop, test or demo different products. With the ability to create channel tabs and easily share devices with the rest of the members, teams can bring all the required tools within the MS Teams channel and increase their productivity significantly.\n\nFinally, the TeamViewer Dashboard, that is available as a personal tab, provides a view of all active sessions, connection history and helpful user guide.

Managers can use the tabs and connectors to get alerts on high priority tickets and monitor tickets for 1 or multiple teams. The app allows you to create new tickets and log action notes from existing conversations or search for existing tickets and share them with others. \nYou can have a conversation with the Revelation bot and ask it to show a list of open tickets. You can also ask the bot for details on a specific ticket or specifics about a ticket like who it is assigned to or when the ticket was last actioned. The Revelation bot can also log new tickets and add action notes for you.\nUse the Revelation helpdesk connector to get instant notifications on ticket activity in your helpdesk. Each connector can be configured to only show notifications for certain types of activity. Filters can also be setup on the connector so that individuals of a team only get notifications for certain clients, teams or queues setup in Revelation helpdesk.\nThe Revelation helpdesk tabs allow a team to monitor a list of their open tickets from inside Microsoft Teams. Multiple tabs can be setup and can be configured to only show tickets for certain teams, clients or tickets assigned to specific queues in Revelation helpdesk. The tab can also be filtered to only show New, Current, At Risk or Late tickets, or filtered by ticket status or priority.

For some that’s discussing goals and priorities, for others that’s talking about professional development. Whatever the topic, Uptick makes sure there’s consistency and some light structure to keep the conversations on-track. As one of our customers said:\n\n\"Uptick is a game-changer. I've got a couple of people that report to me where there were some relationship struggles. And just by using the tool it has completely changed that relationship... there's some vulnerability there that never existed previously... and it's created a lot of trust and much better communication.\"\n\nHow does Uptick work? Well, once into Uptick, you'll be prompted to set up the questions for your 1:1. Our default (but completely customizable) question set will include a discussion of goals, priorities, productivity, personal development, and values.  You can also start your own question set from scratch! From there, you can set up a recurring time for your meeting, and it you like, send out a calendar invitation that will allow you to reschedule and skip your meetings right from Uptick.\n\nOnce the meeting is set up, Uptick sends a notification to the employee to fill out their 1:1 the day before the meeting. The manager will be notified when the employee has submitted the 1:1 in order to review it and take notes. Then, once you’re meeting with your teammate, managers and employees alike can edit the priorities that will be completed before the next 1:1. This gives both people clarity on what’s to be accomplished.\n\nFrom there you get to chat about the things that really matter…professional development, obstacles to success, team dynamics and the values you’d like to focus on. This is where Uptick comes alive, helping develop the kind of relationships with your teammates you hoped you’d have.\n\nYou need to have an Uptick account to get started, so click \"Sign Up\" on the opening screen.\n\nAnd keep on the lookout for some Uptick notification bots, earmarked for release in 2020!","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/bd7ca826-9ff3-42fe-aab9-ea098374afc1_largeImage.png?v=1.0.2","accentColor":"#FFFFFF","id":"bd7ca826-9ff3-42fe-aab9-ea098374afc1","name":"Uptick","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/bd7ca826-9ff3-42fe-aab9-ea098374afc1_smallImage.png?v=1.0.2"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"be1d5beb-963b-4e1d-a8f5-bfe2b5976ce2","appId":"be1d5beb-963b-4e1d-a8f5-bfe2b5976ce2","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200002673","manifestVersion":"1.8","version":"1.0.9","categories":["Communication","Productivity","Utilities"],"developerName":"Teknikos","developerUrl":"https://communifyapp.com","privacyUrl":"https://communifyapp.com/privacy","termsOfUseUrl":"https://communifyapp.com/terms-and-conditions","validDomains":["teamsapp.communifyapp.com","login.microsoftonline.com"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"staticTabs":[{"entityId":"dashboard","name":"Dashboard","contentUrl":"https://teamsapp.communifyapp.com","websiteUrl":"https://teamsapp.communifyapp.com","scopes":["Personal"]},{"entityId":"mymeetings","name":"My Meetings","contentUrl":"https://teamsapp.communifyapp.com/my-meetings","websiteUrl":"https://teamsapp.communifyapp.com/my-meetings","scopes":["Personal"]},{"entityId":"help","name":"Help","contentUrl":"https://teamsapp.communifyapp.com/faq","websiteUrl":"https://teamsapp.communifyapp.com/faq","scopes":["Personal"]},{"entityId":"about","scopes":["Personal"]}],"webApplicationInfo":{"id":"e28612c2-f12b-4964-87d6-74e3871661a8","resource":"https://notapplicable"},"industries":["Other"],"keywords":["exchange","communify","meet"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2021-03-03T16:51:02.3097767+00:00","shortDescription":"Meet conquers workplace friction to get business back to work.

This functionality is not optimal in existing healthcare solutions. We created an innovative solution to provide telehealth for episodic care and remote physiological monitoring for the management of patients with chronic conditions. Using our app, healthcare institutions can enroll administrative and clinical members who in turn can enroll patients into the system and utilize the central repository of securely collected clinical information during clinical care. \n\nSteth IO Telehealth app will enable your healthcare team members to monitor patients’ vital signs like blood pressure, temperature, pulse oximeter readings. It allows them to hear the heart and lung sounds providing innovative technology to examine patients remotely during virtual visits. The system has the ability to collect clinical images of skin rashes, leg swelling, or any other clinically relevant images. It also allows healthcare institutions to interact with their patients on an audio-video call and conduct asynchronous clinical examinations making a virtual health visit complete. \n\nIf you are not enrolled in Steth IO Systems, contact us at https://stethio.com/contact/.

The Go1 Microsoft Teams app comes pre-integrated with Canvas LMS, with more LMS integrations coming soon. Curate and control the visibility of learning resources for different teams and enable your teams to discuss and share any of the content. If you already have learning content in SCORM, AICC, LTI, TinCan, and xAPI, the Go1 app can be used to import these too! Bring people together to learn with the Go1 app by sharing learning content during a Microsoft Teams meeting. The meeting organizer can set the learning content for the meeting and share resources with participants during the meeting. After the meeting, the organizer can see how many participants completed the learning items. Learners can check the status of their learning at any time through the personal tab in the Go1 App. On the personal tab learners will find all their learning items which are in progress, assigned, saved and completed. Learners can also explore new content via the Explore tab in the personal app. If you have any feedback or questions about the app or have an LMS you’d like to see integrated, please reach out to support@go1.com.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/c859de61-8a6b-42e6-ba88-f639df33bc72_largeImage.png?v=1.3.0","accentColor":"#114954","id":"c859de61-8a6b-42e6-ba88-f639df33bc72","name":"Go1","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/c859de61-8a6b-42e6-ba88-f639df33bc72_smallImage.png?v=1.3.0"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"c88b3cd8-6d6f-4645-a897-90a03799650a","appId":"c88b3cd8-6d6f-4645-a897-90a03799650a","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200002696","manifestVersion":"1.5","version":"1.0.0","categories":["HumanResourcesAndRecruiting","Utilities"],"developerName":"GeoVictoria","developerUrl":"https://www.geovictoria.com","privacyUrl":"https://www.geovictoria.com/cl/politica-de-privacidad-y-proteccion-de-datos/","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.geovictoria.com/cl/terms-of-use/","validDomains":["token.botframework.com"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"devicePermissions":["OpenExternal"],"bots":[{"id":"c88b3cd8-6d6f-4645-a897-90a03799650a","scopes":["Personal"],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"supportedLanguages":["es-cl"],"mpnId":"4923088","industries":["Manufacturing","Retail"],"keywords":["geovictoria"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2021-03-15T14:01:51.4377893+00:00","shortDescription":"GeoVictoria Bot le ayudará a obtener la información de sus turnos.","longDescription":"Usando GeoVictoria Bot podrá obtener la información de sus turnos, tanto los pasados como los que tendrá que cumplir.

With no more paper. Not even Post-its! Our seemingly simple app easily integrates with every DMS and Microsoft Teams. And getting started is fast and simple. Then you only pay a small monthly fee for the people actually using iBabs. Which makes it so much easier to scale up (or down) as needed.\n\n**Discover the benefits of paperless meetings**\n\nYou know how much work an effective meeting costs. Just think how much easier it becomes with iBabs. You no longer need paper. Everything that participants need can be found on their screen. And you are in control.\n\n**During the meeting**\n\n**Find past meetings and notes quickly**\n\nJust ask iBabs – and you can quickly find key points from past meeting – whether from last week or last year. You&#39;ll quickly find precisely what you need, without wasting time digging through paper files.\n\n**Updated document? Everyone automatically has the latest version**\n\nBoard members and other meeting participants can easily make notes, change and update documents. And when changes are made, everyone automatically has the latest version. So you don&#39;t have to follow up with emails and chase down team members to give them new documents.\n\n**After the meeting**\n\n**Sensitive document are safe and secure**\n\niBabs safely secures all your files with 256-AES encryption, the same level of security used by banks and departments of defense. So documents stay confidential, and only the people granted access can gain access.\n\n**Review all files on one screen, on any device**\n\nSeamless integration with your DMS (document management system) means you no longer have to search for or upload files. Everything is kept together, and always available for your meetings.\n\n**Coming Soon**\n\niBabs for Teams will grow in functionality. In terms of existing native iBabs functions, but also in functions that reach beyond given by the possibilities the Microsoft Teams platform brings. To give insight when to expect what:\n\n**Q2 2020, initial release of iBabs for Teams extended with:**\n\n- Live voting\n- Agenda item notes\n\n**Q3 2020**\n\n- The creation and editing of meetings\n- Registration of actions and decisions\n- Registration of meeting-minutes\n\n**Q4 2020 and beyond**\n\n- Keep iBabs for Teams functionality in line with the rest of iBabs\n- Extend further integration

Traditionally, many of the processes needed to perform this task involve a lot of manual labor, increasing the potential for human errors. Through digitization the amount of manual labor can be greatly reduced, resulting in an increase in quality and more predicable outcomes.\nGemini Connected digitizes multiple processes that simplifies the flow of information within and across different organizations working on an infrastructure project. Different events happening in the infrastructure project can either be reported directly through this app inside Microsoft Teams, or through any other of the other clients provided in the Gemini Connected eco system.\nGemini Connected allows team members easy access to relevant information from the processes supported by the app. Through the list of items defined in the project scope, the progress of the projects can easily be monitored and followed up. Each progress entry to these items is quality assured, to ensure the required level of documentation.\nWithin modern infrastructure projects there is a lot of focus on moving from drawings to enriched 3D models. In the Gemini Connected eco system, the Gemini Terrain client handles the maintenance of such 3D models. These models are shared between different clients through the Gemini Connected platform service. This app makes it easy to administrate the handling of the data files that holds these models.   \nThe Gemini Connected app provides a tight integration between the Gemini Connected platform service and Microsoft Teams. Access to Gemini Connected is provided through the Microsoft Teams user credentials, and the language of the app is controlled by the settings in Microsoft Teams. By exposing deep links to entities within the Gemini Connected platform, the app allows for easy navigation from emails and channel conversations.\nThe use of this app requires that your organization is using the Gemini Connected platform service, which is a paid service.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/cc649732-0f1c-41be-bb52-fbeaab71c7cf_largeImage.png?v=1.0.0","accentColor":"#FFFFFF","id":"cc649732-0f1c-41be-bb52-fbeaab71c7cf","name":"Gemini Connected","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/cc649732-0f1c-41be-bb52-fbeaab71c7cf_smallImage.png?v=1.0.0"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"ccab758b-383b-45fe-b642-2c97609f2098","appId":"ccab758b-383b-45fe-b642-2c97609f2098","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200001330","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/ccab758b-383b-45fe-b642-2c97609f2098/1.png?v=1.0.0"],"manifestVersion":"1.5","version":"1.0.0","categories":["ITAdmin"],"developerName":"JMA Systems Corp.","developerUrl":"https://www.jmas.co.jp/","privacyUrl":"https://www.jmas.co.jp/privacy_apl/","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.jmas.co.jp/privacy/chatbot_Terms_of_service2019.pdf","validDomains":["token.botframework.com"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"bots":[{"id":"642ec2fa-2213-4cd4-b803-bbd24687b17d","scopes":["Personal"],"isNotificationOnly":false}],"supportedLanguages":["ja-jp"],"mpnId":"2910759","industries":["Other"],"keywords":["ChatBot","FAQ","JMAS"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-02-06T07:43:34.0919164+00:00","shortDescription":"チャットボットがFAQにお答えします","longDescription":"This Solution is Provided for Japanese Language Only. \nAzureをベースとしたAIチャットボットソフトウェアです\n・質問を送信することでBotから適当な回答を得ることができます。\n・以下のように利用することができます。  \n　：EC顧客問い合わせ　リコメンドチャット \n　：社内QAチャット \n・管理者チューニング、学習機能により、より精度の高い回答を提示します\n\nこのアプリでできること\n・メッセージを送ることでBotから回答が返ってきます。\n\nご利用上の注意\n・Azure AD認証が必要なためMSアカウントが必要です。\n・ご使用のアプリケーションは機能限定版となっております。\n・お客様のFAQデータのご利用につきましては登録が必要です。\n　下記のメールアドレスにお問い合わせください。\n　e-mail: ms-sales@jmas.co.jp","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/ccab758b-383b-45fe-b642-2c97609f2098_largeImage.png?v=1.0.0","accentColor":"#009FE2","id":"ccab758b-383b-45fe-b642-2c97609f2098","name":"JMASFAQChatBot","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/ccab758b-383b-45fe-b642-2c97609f2098_smallImage.png?v=1.0.0"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"ccb22b15-aea0-49d2-864d-e3d28ad30fc1","appId":"ccb22b15-aea0-49d2-864d-e3d28ad30fc1","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA104381733","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/ccb22b15-aea0-49d2-864d-e3d28ad30fc1/1.jpeg?v=1.0.1","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/ccb22b15-aea0-49d2-864d-e3d28ad30fc1/2.jpeg?v=1.0.1","https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/ccb22b15-aea0-49d2-864d-e3d28ad30fc1/3.jpeg?v=1.0.1"],"manifestVersion":"1.5","version":"1.0.1","categories":["Productivity","Education"],"developerName":"SAFARI Montage","developerUrl":"https://www.safarimontage.com","privacyUrl":"https://www.safarimontage.com/support/msteamsprivacy.aspx","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.safarimontage.com/termsandconditions.aspx","validDomains":["smteamsapplication.azurewebsites.net"],"permissions":["Identity","MessageTeamMembers"],"bots":[{"id":"ccb22b15-aea0-49d2-864d-e3d28ad30fc1","scopes":["Team"]}],"mpnId":"6043188","industries":["Education"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2020-01-10T15:47:39.5973041+00:00","shortDescription":"SAFARI Montage is the leading K-12 Learning Object Repository.","longDescription":"SAFARI Montage provides K-12 school districts with a fully integrated Learning Object Repository, Video Streaming Library and IPTV & Live Media Streaming, designed to handle video efficiently.

It is designed to help Agile Scrum teams with estimating the complexity of user stories in a more effective and fun way. It can be equally as powerful for estimating effort of key tasks in a project plan using a traditional work breakdown structure.\nThe technique uses numbered cards that are selected individually and privately in order to avoid estimating decisions based on cognitive bias. After cards are revealed – team members discuss the estimates. After everyone has voted the highest and lowest estimates explain their choice and the process is repeated until the team agrees on a value. ScrumPoker also helps to replace physical cards when teams are not in the same geographical locations. ScrumPoker has three roles: project manager/product owner, scrum master, and the development team members.\nScrumPoker implements methodology by providing given functionality:\n                - Create time-framed ScrumPoker planning session rooms\n                - Invite other Scrum team members to join ScrumPoker session with a given URL address. After team members go through the Join Session form, they have to enter a member name, and in some cases the session password.\n                - Extend time-limited ScrumPoker planning session on demand\n                - Start voting process by selecting one of the numbered cards privately: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 (story points are used in Fibonacci-like format because it helps to push the team to make tough decisions. Until the process is completed and everyone has voted, members can still change their mind.\n                - Show voting results publicly once all the Scrum team members place their votes\n                - Show voting results publicly once ScrumPoker session master initiates show action\n                - Reach final estimate consensus by analyzing voting results and discussing noticeable exclusions\n\nLet's estimate user stories in a gamified fashion and enjoy IT!","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/d400ec73-d695-4065-b8c2-102d89c18077_largeImage.png?v=1.0.0","accentColor":"#2B374A","id":"d400ec73-d695-4065-b8c2-102d89c18077","name":"Scrum-Poker","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/d400ec73-d695-4065-b8c2-102d89c18077_smallImage.png?v=1.0.0"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"d4705e8f-9b64-422e-9ad6-863533e18e00","appId":"d4705e8f-9b64-422e-9ad6-863533e18e00","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA200001429","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/d4705e8f-9b64-422e-9ad6-863533e18e00/1.png?v=1.0.0"],"manifestVersion":"1.5","version":"1.0.0","categories":["ProjectManagement","Productivity","ITAdmin"],"developerName":"Oversee

B2B brands use Qualified to accelerate pipeline growth by identifying their most valuable buyers when they visit their website, understanding their intent and then instantly starting a conversation via live chat, voice or video calls, and screen-sharing.\n\nQualified helps you maximize every dollar spent on demand generation by enabling buyers to have real-time conversations with your company, on their terms. It is the only conversational sales and marketing platform designed to run natively on Salesforce and works seamlessly with complex enterprise business processes. Qualified is ranked first in its category on the Salesforce AppExchange and a High Performer on G2 Crowd.\n\nQualified understands your sales and marketing teams are busy, which means they’re preoccupied and completely unaware when interested buyers hit your website. That’s why it’s important to flag these interested buyers for your sales team so they can jump into a conversation and nurture each prospect when it matters most.\n\nWith Qualified, you can configure alerts for your internal teams sent by the Microsoft Teams bot. Example strategies include:\n* The ABM Red Carpet: when a visitor lands on your site, we'll identify their company immediately and match that against your list of target accounts in Salesforce. We'll then alert the account team for immediate action using the Microsoft Teams bot.\n* The Open Opportunity Fast Lane: recognize immediately when a company visits your website that has an open Opportunity in Salesforce. Greet them by name then use the Microsoft Teams bot to notify the account owner.\n* The Pricing Page Expert: visitors on a pricing page are typically further down the sales funnel and ready to convert. Use the Microsoft Teams bot to notify sales leadership and prompt the SDR to proactively start a conversation.\n* The Existing Customer Upsell: automatically identify existing customers when they arrive on your site then use the Microsoft Teams bot to notify the account owner for upsell opportunities.\n\nGet started: reach out to [sales@qualified.com](mailto:sales@qualified.com)\nHelp: visit

For a long time, lectures have been a one-way delivery system for information, offering little opportunity for student engagement. Overcoming this obstacle is central to our mission: helping teachers build engaging learning activities.\n\nWe have developed a suite of pedagogical tools that integrate into Microsoft Teams and learning management systems to provide teachers extensive capabilities in their course designs, and improve the quality of students' learning experience. In terms of user experience, all tools in our suite have a similar look and feel, which flattens the learning curve for teachers and students.\n\nThe available tools in the suite support learning activities related to pedagogical themes such as: peer assessment, interaction within study material, collaborative learning, team based learning, skill feedback and engaging online discussions.\n\nPeer Feedback tools structure and streamline the process of students reviewing skills or work from peers. The teacher specifies criteria by which students evaluate peers and set instructions deadlines. The entire process of peer allocation is automated. Learning activity example: Students peer assess each others’ draft group reports before the final hand-in or students give feedback on their peers' collaboration skills so teachers discover free riders in group projects.\n\nInteractive Study Material tools enhance the process of students consuming study content such as articles, videos or podcasts. The problem is that students are often only passively consuming content. These tools add interactivity and foster social learning to enhance the study experience. Learning activity example: Ask students to add comments in readings or videos prior to a lecture (flipping the classroom).\n\nOnline discussion tools have the purpose of encouraging critical and reflective thinking and generating dialogue with peers. This is done by providing explicit instructions and facilitating a step by step meaningful dialogue. Learning activity example: Organise an open-ended, formative or summative discussion at scale.\n\nInteractive classrooms tools are built to foster engagement in class. It allows you to add interactive questions to existing powerpoint slides. A low-barrier solution that avoids students to passively attend your lectures.\n\nLearning activity example: Students anonymously answer controversial questions in class.","largeImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/e5349cd7-43a3-41c1-a9f9-bc53805033ef_largeImage.png?v=1.0.2","accentColor":"#2E7D32","id":"e5349cd7-43a3-41c1-a9f9-bc53805033ef","name":"FeedbackFruits","smallImageUrl":"https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/e5349cd7-43a3-41c1-a9f9-bc53805033ef_smallImage.png?v=1.0.2"},"userLocale":"en-us"},{"cacheKey":"e542a070-4325-4794-ab33-ec988b944e3b","appId":"e542a070-4325-4794-ab33-ec988b944e3b","item":{"officeAssetId":"WA104381357","screenshotUrls":["https://statics.teams.cdn.office.net/evergreen-assets/ThirdPartyApps/screenshots/e542a070-4325-4794-ab33-ec988b944e3b/1.png?v=1.2.2"],"manifestVersion":"1.0","version":"1.2.2","categories":["Communication","Reference"],"developerName":"iCliniq","developerUrl":"https://www.icliniq.com/apps/msteam","privacyUrl":"https://www.icliniq.com/p/privacy","termsOfUseUrl":"https://www.icliniq.com/p/terms","permissions":[],"bots":[{"id":"e542a070-4325-4794-ab33-ec988b944e3b","scopes":["Personal"],"commandLists":[{"scopes":["Personal"],"commands":[{"title":"Help","description":"Displays help message"},{"title":"Search","description":"Search iCliniq for previously answered health questions and articles."},{"title":"Ask","description":"Ask your health query to get medical second opinion from doctors on iCliniq."},{"title":"Menu","description":"Displays the menus"},{"title":"Sign up","description":"To connect/sign up your email with iCliniq Bot"},{"title":"Logout","description":"Logout of your iCliniq account."}]}]}],"industries":["Other"],"lastUpdatedAt":"2019-12-16T23:25:23.1164592+00:00","shortDescription":"Get medical second opinion to your health queries from doctors on iCliniq.","longDescription":"iCliniq medical second opinion bot will help you get your health queries answered by real doctors. iCliniq is a global online medical second opinion platform with more than 2500 doctors, from 80+ medical specialties. iCliniq has solved more than 700,000 health issues for patients across 196 countries. iCliniq has been rated among the top 5 telemedicine platforms in the world by Healthline and Investopedia. iCliniq's core strength is it's quality of consultations as the team puts in a lot of efforts to increase the telehealth savviness of doctors.

No worries!

Note that after the de-authorization, the \"Report\" command will be unavailable. Re-authorization is needed to use the \"Report\" command after de-authorization. \n\nThe \"Report\" command generates security reports on for users. The reports reflect suspicious messages/users across all the teams of which the user is a member. The \"Help\" command provides information on the available commands for users.\n\nBy using this app, users can easily generate security reports of all the joined teams. Every report could include several sub-reports, each corresponds to a team that the user is a member of. In every sub-report, all members of the team are listed as entries. Each entry contains the full name of the member, the email address of the member, the number of suspicious messages sent by the member, the number of all the messages sent by the member, and the content of the suspicious messages. Note that all the messages are scanned through Clearedin service and we have a well-built and trustworthy trust-graph, together with a huge amount of data from the internet. In this way, the user gets a good overview of the security situation of himself/herself.\n\nWhy Clearedin?\n\nClearedin is an application with a clear mission — to protect organizations from the insidious threat of phishing attacks.

You can create communities for projects, groups topics or any common interests.\n\nOnce an AllAnswered team is connected to your Microsoft Team by the team administrators, each community can be individually mapped to a specific channel in Microsoft Teams so they will work together seamlessly.\n\nPlease note:  There is no charge for the this integration, but you need a subscription to AllAnswered to use our knowledge management system. We also offer 14-day free trial and no credit card is required.

Upon adding ServiceBot, the integration will perform the following actions:\n- Allow the use of built-in commands to fetch, filter and track specific incidents and service requests. This helps agents collaborate on a ticket and solve issues faster.\n- Send notifications when a ticket is assigned to an agent/group.\n- Send notifications when you receive a reply to a ticket, or when a note is added to a ticket that is assigned to you.\n- Allow an agent to perform quick actions on an assigned ticket like sending a reply, adding a private/public note, right from their Microsoft Teams account\n- Allow approvers to quickly approve/reject a service request that is assigned to them.\n\nFreshservice is a cloud-based IT service desk that is easy-to-set up, quick to learn, and is effective in automating your routine internal tasks. It helps your employees raise requests or seek assistance through a self-service portal and allows your IT team to quickly pick up those tickets and fulfill them on time. Freshservice can also be used by HR, legal, admin or facilities team to handle internal requests.\n\nThe integration helps IT agents collaborate better as a team. Imagine an incident being raised in an IT service desk. Once the ticket is assigned to an agent they can login to Microsoft Teams, fetch their ticket and work on it with help from fellow team members. This way all team members are aware of who is working on which ticket and also can contribute their suggestions and feedback thereby making team collaboration more effective. This also helps in being more productive and helps in resolving tickets faster.\n\nIn order to use the ServiceBot, users must have an active Freshservice account. Please contact your IT administrator for more details.\nPlease make sure that you have completed the Microsoft Teams setup in Freshservice via the Freshservice app gallery. Post which, proceed to install the ServiceBot in Teams.

With a little upfront focus on getting in sync, your team will have shorter video meetings, fewer chat interruptions, and more time to get stuff done.\n\n_Here’s how it works:_\n\n**Share a Check-in** — Range sends a reminder to your Outlook each morning to help you build a simple habit of planning your day, reflecting on your work, and sharing that with your team as a Check-in. \n\n**Stay in sync** — As teammates Check-in, you’ll see what they’re working on, right in Microsoft Teams. Just add the Range tab to your team, and you’ll always know what everyone’s working on and the progress they’ve made.\n\n**Better meetings** — Range helps your video calls go more smoothly. Just add Range to your meetings, and you’ll see a sidebar during your call with Check-ins from your team. Rather than long-winded status updates, everyone can get the gist from reading Check-ins and then dive into more meaningful conversations about the work.\n\n**Feel connected** — We’ve woven in team building features throughout Range to help your team feel connected while working from home (and to make work just a little more fun). Share how you’re feeling, get to know your teammates with questions, or send an emoji thank you to a coworker.\n\n**Coming soon** — Publish Check-ins right from Microsoft Teams and easily share and
